# Food-Donation-App
A food donation app connects donors, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals, with charities and people in need. It helps reduce food waste by facilitating real-time donations of surplus food, ensuring it reaches those who need it most. Users can list available food, schedule pickups, and track donations easily. With features like location-based matching and instant notifications, the app streamlines the donation process, making it more efficient and accessible. By bridging the gap between surplus and scarcity, a food donation app plays a vital role in combating hunger and promoting sustainability.
